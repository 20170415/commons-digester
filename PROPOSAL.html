<title>Proposal for Digester3 Package</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

<div align="center">
<h1>Proposal for <em>Digester3</em> Package</h1>
</div>

<h3>(0) Rationale</h3>

<p>
  The Digester3 is an almost complete rewrite of the original Digester implementation, which offers:
    <li>A universal loader: core features and extensions became not so easy
    to maintain, since every contribution was created with a different approach;
    a fresh new architecture is able to load modules that allow users
    write and include easily their own extensions;</li>
    <li>Reusability of Digester configurations: what was missing is a way to
    <i>describe</i> how the Digester instances have to be built and not how
    to set rules given an existing instance;</li>
    <li>Rules are now expressed via EDSL: the key feature of Digester3 is expressing
    rule bindings using a fluent APIs collection, that speak more in English rather
    than in a programming language;</li>
    <li>Improved errors reporting: rules binding debug operations have made easier,
    a detailed errors list of wrong binding is reported just when the loader
    attempts to create a new Digester instance, and not when running it.</li>
</p>

<h3>(1) Scope of the Package</h3>

<p>
  The Digester3 package is intended to provide to Commons users a new Digester experience, simplifying tasks such
  rules binding, now expressed via fluent APIs, and extensions development, simplified by a fresh new architecture
  based on modules.
</p>

<p>
  Digester3 is not compatible with previous releases of Digester.
</p>

<h3>(1.5) Interaction With Other Packages</h3>

<p>Like the current Digester, Digester3 should rely on standard Java 1.5 and on
Apache Commons Logging, Apache Commons Beanutils.
For development, it utilizes the JUnit4 unit testing framework,
maven 2 or 3 and general quality checking tools (coding style, test coverage,
classical error patterns monitoring).</p>

<p>No external configuration files are utilized.</p>


<h3>(2) Initial Source of the Package</h3>

<p>
The initial codebase will be imported from an unpublished proof of concept
developed by the proposal creator.</p>

<p>The proposed package name for the new component is
<code>org.apache.commons.digester3</code>.</p>


<h3>(3)  Required Commons Resources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Subversion Repository - New directory <code>digester3</code> in the
    <code>commons</code> subversion repository.</li>
<li>Mailing List - Discussions will take place on the general
    <em>dev@commons.apache.org</em> mailing list.  To help
    list subscribers identify messages of interest, it is suggested that
    the message subject of messages about this component be prefixed with
    [digester3].</li>
<li>Jira - New component "digester3" under the "Commons" product
    category, with appropriate version identifiers as needed.</li>
</ul>


<h3>(4) Initial Committers</h3>

<p>The initial committers on the Digester3 component shall be:
