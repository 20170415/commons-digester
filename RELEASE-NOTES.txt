                          Commons Digester Package
                                Version 1.2
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for this version of the Commons
Digester package, and highlights changes since the previous version.  The
current release adds new features and bug fixes, and is being done now to
follow the release early/release often mentality.


NEW FEATURES:

* XMLRules.  Allows a Digester user to define Digester Rules in xml, and then
  load them at runtime.  
  Check it out in the org.apache.commons.digester.xmlrules package.

* Logging.  Digester has been updated to use the Commons logging package.  This
  will allow the Digester user to plug in their logging system.  Check out the
  Commons logging package for more information.


BUG FIXES:

* Rule.body() used to get a trim()'ed version of the body text.  This can affect
  some systems adversely.  Digester's built-in Rule implementations trim()
  internally to maintain behavior of previous releases, but rule implementors
  should take this into account.
