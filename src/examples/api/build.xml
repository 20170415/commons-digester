API Examples Script
===================
Provides helpful services to get folks up and running
the examples quickly.

* Compile - compiles all the examples to the directories
in which the their source files reside.

* Run - runs each example in turn. 

Note: 
These examples will only build and run if the 
rights jars are in the classpath. The classpath
can be set by copying the build.properties.sample file
in this directory to build.properties and then setting
the properties appropriately. Or by editing the 
build.properties file (based on the build.properties.sample
file in CVS) so that it contains absolute paths.

Note:
build.xml files are provided in each subdirectory. This
provide similar fuctionality for each example individually.

Note:
The examples are graduated. It is best to look at them 
in order. Please consult the documentation for more details.
