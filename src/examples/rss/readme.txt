This directory contains the example code for parsing RSS (Really Simple
Syndication) newsfeeds, which was originally included directly in the
commons-digester.jar file, in package "org.apache.commons.digester.rss".
The package name has not been changed, so the only impact on applications
relying on these classes will be the need to include an additional JAR
file (commons-digester-rss.jar) in their classpath.
