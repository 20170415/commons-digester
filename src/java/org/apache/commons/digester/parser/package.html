Provides for parser recognition and parser dependent code.

<p>
Digester aims to support the widest range possible of parsers.
Unfortunately, there are a few parser settings which have no been standardized.
In most cases, the best practice is for the user to configure the parser 
themselves and pass it to Digester to use.
</p>
<p>
There are a few reasonable exceptions which Digesters makes to this general rule.
There are a small number of common use cases where insisting that the user
configure the parser may reduce the portability of applications using Digester.
These are outlined below.
</p>
<h4>Validating With Schema</h4>
<p>
When validating using schemas (rather than DTDs),
settings for schema language and schema location are commonly needed.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of standardization for these settings.
In particular, for older versions of Xerces, these are set differently
from newer versions.
</p>
<p>
In order to aid portability for this common use case, Digester uses
the classes in this package (together with <code>ParserFeatureSetterFactory</code>)
to guess the parser and set these properties appropriately.
The aim is for Digester to automagically recognize and configure each parser.
Help would be gratefully appreciated to maintain and improve the support in this area.
