Provides for manipulation of xml attributes and element body text before
the data is processed by any Rule objects.
<br><br>
<p>
The class org.apache.commons.digester.Substitutor defines an abstract
interface for mechanisms which manipulate xml attributes and body text.
The Digester method setSubstitutor can be used to define a concrete
substitutor that will be applied to the data before it is passed to the
matching rules.
</p>
<p>
This package provides some useful concrete implementations of the abstract
Substitutor class. In particular, it provides an implementation that allows
the application to define "variables" which the input data can reference
using a syntax such as "${user.name}".
